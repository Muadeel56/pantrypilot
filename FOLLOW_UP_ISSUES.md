# Follow-up Issues for Performance & PWA Readiness

Based on the performance baseline analysis, the following issues should be created:

## Issue #1: Performance - Optimize Core Web Vitals
**Priority**: HIGH
**Labels**: performance, critical

### Description
Current Core Web Vitals are failing performance standards:
- First Contentful Paint: 4.1s (target: <1.8s)
- Largest Contentful Paint: 6.4s (target: <2.5s)
- Cumulative Layout Shift: 0.304 (target: <0.1)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FCP < 1.8s
- [ ] LCP < 2.5s
- [ ] CLS < 0.1
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score > 90

### Technical Tasks
- [ ] Implement critical CSS inlining
- [ ] Optimize critical rendering path
- [ ] Add explicit dimensions to prevent layout shifts
- [ ] Defer non-critical JavaScript

## Issue #2: Performance - Implement Code Splitting
**Priority**: HIGH
**Labels**: performance, optimization

### Description
Current bundle is 92.3KB with all routes bundled together. Need to implement route-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Initial bundle size < 50KB
- [ ] Routes loaded on-demand
- [ ] No impact on user experience
- [ ] Bundle analysis shows proper splitting

### Technical Tasks
- [ ] Configure Vite for route-based splitting
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for routes
- [ ] Add loading states for route transitions
- [ ] Test bundle splitting effectiveness

## Issue #3: Performance - Bundle Optimization
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Labels**: performance, optimization

### Description
Analyze and optimize bundle composition to remove unused code and dependencies.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bundle analysis completed
- [ ] Unused dependencies removed
- [ ] Tree shaking optimized
- [ ] Bundle size reduced by 20-30%

### Technical Tasks
- [ ] Run bundle analyzer
- [ ] Identify unused dependencies
- [ ] Optimize imports
- [ ] Configure tree shaking

## Issue #4: PWA - Service Worker Implementation
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Labels**: pwa, performance

### Description
Implement service worker for caching and offline functionality to improve PWA readiness.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Service worker implemented
- [ ] Static assets cached
- [ ] Offline functionality working
- [ ] Update notifications added

### Technical Tasks
- [ ] Create service worker
- [ ] Implement caching strategy
- [ ] Add offline page
- [ ] Configure update notifications

## Issue #5: PWA - Web App Manifest
**Priority**: LOW
**Labels**: pwa, enhancement

### Description
Add web app manifest for PWA installation and metadata.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Manifest.json created
- [ ] App icons configured
- [ ] Display mode set
- [ ] PWA installable

### Technical Tasks
- [ ] Create manifest.json
- [ ] Generate app icons
- [ ] Configure display settings
- [ ] Test PWA installation

## Issue #6: Performance - Image Optimization
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Labels**: performance, optimization

### Description
Optimize images for better performance and implement lazy loading.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Images in next-gen formats (WebP/AVIF)
- [ ] Lazy loading implemented
- [ ] Proper image dimensions
- [ ] Improved LCP scores

### Technical Tasks
- [ ] Convert images to WebP/AVIF
- [ ] Implement lazy loading
- [ ] Add responsive images
- [ ] Optimize image delivery

---

## Issue #7: Performance - Caching Strategy
**Priority**: LOW
**Labels**: performance, optimization

### Description
Implement proper caching headers and strategies for better repeat visit performance.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cache headers configured
- [ ] Static assets cached
- [ ] API responses cached appropriately
- [ ] Improved repeat visit performance

### Technical Tasks
- [ ] Configure cache headers
- [ ] Implement cache strategies
- [ ] Add cache invalidation
- [ ] Monitor cache effectiveness

## Performance Budget

### Current vs Target
| Metric | Current | Target | Priority |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| JavaScript Bundle | 92.3KB | <50KB | HIGH |
| CSS Bundle | 12.4KB | <10KB | MEDIUM |
| FCP | 4.1s | <1.8s | HIGH |
| LCP | 6.4s | <2.5s | HIGH |
| CLS | 0.304 | <0.1 | HIGH |
| TBT | 89ms | <200ms | âœ… PASSING |

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Lighthouse CI
- [ ] Configure performance budgets
- [ ] Add Core Web Vitals monitoring
- [ ] Create performance dashboard
